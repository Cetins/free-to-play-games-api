# Free Games To Play

This project created for CodeClan as a homework. It pulls data from freetogame API and displays with simple user interface coded with React. For more information about the API source please visit => https://www.freetogame.com/ 

## Functionality

It's a one page app, displays all the games in card view. User can use the select genre dropdown to narrow the results by genre. The app renders all the games in the beginning, after select a genre to narrow results user can go back to display all results by selecting the `all` option in the dropdown. Every game card has a link to games website. User can click and visit.

### Cors Extension

API in this project requires cors. You can add this extension to your Chrome browser to overcome cors problems in general. Link for the extension I'm using is https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cross-domain-cors/mjhpgnbimicffchbodmgfnemoghjakai . After adding this extension go to the settings and change it to enable only when selected. Otherwise this extension runs in all websites you browse and breaks most of them :) I've added a shortcut to top bar of browser and I only run this extension when working with my projects.

Feel free to contribute this project but run & test on your local before merging. I may go back to my old projects time to time make some additions, so please don't break it :)

Happy coding!
